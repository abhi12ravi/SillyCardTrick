This is a very naive implementation of a card trick I had learnt in my school days. I had implemented the same in my college days in C and thought that it will be a good first step to my entry in developing Android app.

I built it using Eclipse Plugin and I reallt dont know how you are going to build it. Probably you will also have to use the Eclipse plugin.

Presently the number of cards displayed at the first run is fixed. I will randomize it in the next release.
